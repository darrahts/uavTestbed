<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a complete UAV simulation testbed that is intended to be used with the [data management framework](https://github.com/darrahts/data_management_framework). A Postgres database schema and an API in MATLAB / python is used in conjunction. This framework will support a wide variety of simulation-based experiments as well as real-world experiments using the same interface.  

This is a Work In Progress [WIP]! Updates are being made as of July 15th, 2022. Many of these steps may remain out of date for the time being.

Currenlty we are conducting several run-to-failure experiments in effort to collect telementry and degradation data to facilitate research into deep learning approaches to problems such as remaining useful life (RUL) estimation, fault detection & isolation (FDI), decision making, and others.  

TODO
- finish refactoring the framework
- add power demand estimation based on trajectory
- add in trajectory risk / reward 
- add in-mission decision making and actions
    - activities such as drop package, take picture, transmit data, etc
    - appropriate power demand based on activity
- more...



### Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL 12+ (other versions are probably fine but untested)
* MATLAB r2022a (r2020 had database issues and now some functionality has been updated in r2022a that is not backwards compatible with r2020).

### Setup

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/darrahts/uavTestbed && cd uavTestbed`

2. Clone the [data management framework repo](https://github.com/darrahts/data_management_framework) and follow the installation instructions to install postgres and timescaledb. NOTE: windows ports of some scripts are in progress. 

3. Execute the SQL scripts which extend the data management framework for the UAV simulation.

4. **Optional** Install [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/), a database management application and follow [the guide here](https://github.com/darrahts/uavTestbed/blob/main/postgres_dbeaver_guide.pdf) to set up a remote connection to your database.  

5. **Optional** Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).


## Usage

**Note**
  - There is an [active support case](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/685033-sqlwrite-broken-in-r2020b-vs-r2020a-for-date-time-types) regarding an error with code in MATLAB's database toolbox that drops miliseconds from the telemetry data. This causes the transaction to fail due to violating the unique constraint on the dt column. The current workaround is to sample the at 1hz. 

**NOTE** This has been tested on Windows 10 with ODBC driver and R2020a. Currently working on a Linux implementation with the native postgres driver and R2021a. Here is [another active support case](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/1441564-sqlwrite-still-broken-in-r2021a-for-datatype-conversions?s_tid=srchtitle) regarding the errors within MATLAB.

Run the file [example.mlx](https://github.com/darrahts/uavTestbed/blob/main/livescripts/example.mlx). The original octocopter and dynamics are no longer supported (although still work), and therefore it is recommended to use the tarot uav instead (it is also alot faster due to different implementation of the dynamics). 

**Prerequisites**
  - setup a database following the above instructions and included the default setups
  - have the database connection setup in MATLAB ([instructions here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/database/ug/configuring-driver-and-data-source.html))



Discuss the following: 
- database schema (PHM 2021 paper)
- trajectory selection (aerospace journal paper)
- Degradation (2020 AIAA paper)
- RUL estimation
- parameter estimation 
- train/test/validation data

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

To be incorporated:  

* takeoff and landing 
* prognostics-based waypoint selection
* power estimation based on trajectory
* 4D flight plan
* dynamic craft speed based on flight plan
* mission or maintenance scheduling
* optimize flight time vs maintenance time
* in-mission decision making
* NN-based decision making
* multi-agent mission assignment
* multi-agent resource allocation 
* more...
